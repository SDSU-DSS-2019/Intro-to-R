The version above is\na concept created by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and Adapted\nfrom [Bradley Boehmke](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/).\n\nThe diagram shows the natural flow of how we work with data and perform\nresearch. We will begin to explore what this means as we continue.\n\nData Wrangling\n==============\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/img/wf2.png\" style=\"height:175px\">\n</center>\nThe first steps we take in any Data Analysis is Data Wrangling. Before\nwe can do any kind of analysis we need to be able to collect our data.\nSometimes this comes in from one source but many times this comes from\nmultiple data sources.\n\nOnce we have this data we find that very rarely is it ever in a useful\nform. In fact [Dasau and\nJohnson](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471268518.html)\nsuggest that this data preparation of cleaning may take up to 80% of the\ntime.\n\nThis is where R has great power and by the end of this course you will\nbe able to work with multiple data sources and wrangle data like a pro.\n\nImporting Data\n--------------\n\nWhen it comes to importing your data R is very powerful. R can grab data\nfrom many courses including\n\n-   .csv, .txt. .xls, ....\n-   SPSS, SAS, Stata\n-   Web Scraping\n-   Databases\n    -   MySQL\n    -   Oracle\n    -   PostgreSQL\n    -   MongoDB\n\nTidying Data\n------------\n\nTidying Data is the process in making data useful. In this concept we\nhave ecah column of data represent a variable and each row of data\nrepresents a single observation. This format is quite useful for data\nanalysis. In this course we will rely heavily on the `tidyr` package.\n\nTransforming Data\n-----------------\n\nOnce we have data into R and begin to tidy the data we usually need to\ntransform multiple aspects of the data. R has many tools that allow a\nuser to manipulate and transform data.\n\nData Exploration and Analysis\n=============================\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/img/wf6.png\" style=\"height:225px\">\n</center>\nR is one of the most capable languages to explore and analyze data. With\nover 10,000 packages it can be hard to find models or plots that do not\nalready have multiple functions in R.\n\nVisualizing Data\n----------------\n\nThere are multiple ways to vizualize data in R. The base graphics are\neasy to use and outperform Stata, SAS and SPSS. In this course we will\nfocus on using the [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) package. This package\nis actually a language for grahpics and once a user becomes proficient\nyou can create grahs like the one shown below which is created by\n[Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social\nScience](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/event/introduction-r-graphics-ggplot2-0).\nThe original plot came from the economist:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/img/ggplot_orig.png\" >\n</center>\nThen below can be created by ggplot without any outside graphics\nsoftware.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/img/ggplot_R.png\" >\n</center>\nModeling Data\n-------------\n\nOnce data has been vizualized it is important to model the data. R can\nhandle anything from a simple t-test to the working with data that is\novera terrabyte in size.\n\nData Collaboration and Publishing\n=================================\n\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/img/wf10.png\" style=\"height:225px\">\n</center>\n\nIn every field it is key to be able to communicate what we learn and\npublish this work so that it can be beneficial to others. It is also\nimportant that statisticians can collaborate with others as well.\nRstudio provides many tools to do these things:\n\n-   `RStudio` connects easily to:\n    -   [Github](https://www.github.com/)\n    -   [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/)\n    -   [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)\n-   `shiny` provides an interactive data visualization and java\n    script environment.\n-   `plotly` allows for interactive graphics for webpages.\n-   `RStudio` can make webpages, books, slides, and many other documents\n    that can help relay data. (In fact this course was entirely built in\n    RStudio using Github).\n",
